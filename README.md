# Battle IA

Welcome to the Battle IA project! This is an exciting venture into the world of  programming, and bot battles. The project is a part of the curriculum at the Adimaker engineering foundation course, where students are challenged to develop their bots using C#.
About the Project

Battle IA is a multi-player game where bots, powered by AI, compete in a console-based simulated environment. The goal is to maximize energy efficiency and survival in a dynamic, ever-changing environment that includes energy capsules, shields, and the possibility of going invisible.
## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code. Instructions on setting up your development environment are provided in the project's documentation. (ðŸš§ Work in progress)
## How the Simulation Works

Each bot in the simulation starts with 100 energy units. The simulation revolves around turns where each bot performs a sequence of actions that involve energy consumption, scanning of the terrain, and executing the chosen action. Each action has a cost in terms of energy, and the bot's survival in the game is linked to how well it manages its energy reserves.
## Project Structure

The project is primarily structured into two sections:

1)  Bot Coding: This involves designing and coding the bots using C# or Javascript. An example bot in C# has been provided to get you started.

2)  Simulator: The simulator is provided and is used for executing the game. It supports an unlimited number of bots.

Note: More technical details about the bot's decision-making logic and strategies will be provided in a follow-up article on my blog.

### Acknowledgements

This project was made possible by Professor StÃ©phane Fardoux, my project partner Maxime Eisma, and the enthusiastic participation of my classmates. Their collective efforts have made this project an enriching and exciting journey.

Stay tuned for exciting bot battles.
